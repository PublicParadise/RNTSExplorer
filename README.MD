RNTSExplorer
============

This project is a conversion of the React Native UIExplorer in Typescript.


The two main goals are to provide:

 - a testbed for the react-native type definitions
 - copy/paste examples of React Native in Typescript
 


**Work in Progress**

 I perform  this work on scarce spare time.
 Help is welcome
 
 
 Directories
 -----------
 
  - `js`: the not yet converted files
  - `typescript`: the converted files
  - `gen`: the js generated from typescript
 
 Import statements of (not converted) js files in Typescript will show as a warning but will not prevent emitting the js code.
 
 
 Building
 --------
 
 Use `grunt dev` to compile. (`grunt-cli` must be installed)
